so humid out here my grip is completely

65
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,560

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,519
it only going to go like 60 70% there

67
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,519

00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,040
consisting of upper and lower body a

93
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,319
little bit of a circuit I'm obviously

94
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,959
not playing for the next few days so I

95
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:53,959
like to get a LIF

96
00:03:55,130 --> 00:04:01,799
[Music]

97
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:05,599
in through the CH

98
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,599
deep on the wings

99
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,920
in

100
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:21,759
the I also work kind of plyometric

101
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,240
movements after doing the squat just cuz

102
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,120
I don't like to do too much heavy leg

103
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,800
work before tournaments and just feel

104
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,800
nice and springy and plyometric for the

105
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,800
matches

106
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,400
for

107
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,880
thein and of course finished with the

108
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,880
cool down on the bike and a trip to the

109
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:49,160
[Music]

110
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:53,400
[Applause]

111
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:55,400
sauna oh yeah little bit of SAA recovery

112
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,120
nice big saer to myself I usually do

113
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,280
about 5 10 minutes in here and then uh

114
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,600
yeah follow it up with uh a nice cold

115
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,039
shower and then I think we'll head to

116
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,240
lunch I usually do a little bit of

117
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:08,720
stretching in here just to help with the

118
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,000
the Muscle Recovery um I think saers are

119
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,120
really beneficial if you can go three

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,199
four times consistently each week I'm a

121
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,680
real big believer in saers so yeah for

122
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:17,080
all of you guys that are considering

123
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,759
going in Spar and stuff like that in

124
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,319
saers I'd highly recommend it also

125
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,880
recommend the ice plunge but I don't

126
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:24,360
know whether they have one here but it's

127
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,000
basically just really cold water like an

128
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,280
ice bath not very fun but has to be done

129
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,840
for Recovery they don't have hot water

130
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,840
so I'm I have to have ice C

131
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,500
[Music]

132
00:05:54,199 --> 00:06:01,639
shower well that explains it should have

133
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,639
showered in the room big mistake

134
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:05,470
[Music]

135
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,080
got myself an iced

136
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:19,759
Americano The Barley stand is pretty

137
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,599
expensive this and this sparkling water

138
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,759
cost me

139
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:27,160
£7 which quite a lot actually so yeah

140
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:29,160
they didn't have prices but I needed a

141
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:32,319
caffeine hit uh with us going to the

142
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,360
practice TI in uh just a bit Jamie's

143
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,440
preparing he's hoping he's going to get

144
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,840
in he's I think he's alternate 18 or

145
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,440
something so we're both praying Rory me

146
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,120
and him are all praying that he gets in

147
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,240
and I'm slightly optimistic

148
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:52,000
so it's one good iced Americano I can't

149
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:55,479
lie got some chicken apple some

150
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,280
rice what are your thoughts pretty good

151
00:06:55,479 --> 00:07:01,520
rating out of

152
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,520
10 7.1

153
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:10,280
7.1 some interesting flavors I can't

154
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,479
lie needs a bit of sauce though I'll

155
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,599
give it a

156
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:16,160
6.2 not the best wouldn't order again

157
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:17,520
but it gets the job done then it was

158
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,000
time to head to the tennis club and the

159
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,120
tennis venue to see what the courts were

160
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,440
like and when we got there we were a

161
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,560
little bit shocked right guys we've uh

162
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,560
assess the courts this is where we're

163
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,560
playing

164
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,919
what do we think good

165
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,960
level it's not looking good boys but in

166
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,960
reality they had literally just built

167
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,520
seven brand new courts I think literally

168
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,440
the week before these courts looked in

169
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,080
amazing condition so yeah the site looks

170
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,919
insane they've got barley on the back of

171
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,199
the Court which is epic we can film

172
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:49,840
really easily because they've actually

173
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:51,879
got the back of the the fencing is not

174
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,560
on so yeah it looks sick I'm really

175
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:55,520
looking forward to it now and they even

176
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,120
had a tennis players area I was

177
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,639
completely in shock so this is for the

178
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,400
players it's completely air conditioned

179
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,840
so it's actually freezing cold they got

180
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,319
like a blower uh air conditioning unit

181
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,199
over there it's really nice yeah very

182
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:08,520
solid site I'm I'm going to go to the

183
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,960
tourn Des now see if I can get some

184
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,599
racket strong overall I'm very impressed

185
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,960
this site looks epic at the time of

186
